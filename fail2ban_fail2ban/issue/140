[check_fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/blob/master/files/nagios/check_fail2ban)). But if you want, I just created a [new script](https://github.com/labynocle/nagios_plugins_by_labynocle/tree/master/check_fail2ban_activity) (in perl) which could replace the oldest one.\r\n\r\nThis new script respects all the Nagios requierements (like status, output, perfdata, help...).\r\n\r\nI will be proud to humbly participate to the fail2ban project. Tell me if you're interested :)\r\nBy the way, thanks to all the fail2ban team for this great work.\r\n", issueState = "open", issueId = 11926087, issueComments = 6, issueMilestone = Nothing}
