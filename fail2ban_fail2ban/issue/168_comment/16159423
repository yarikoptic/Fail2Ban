You raise a good point about changing the socket location, but not sure how often that becomes a requirement to be changed. With systemd tmpfiles, installed packages should put their config to create such directories in _/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/*.conf_, and if you want to change it, you can override this file by putting one of the same file name in _/etc/tmpfiles.d/*.conf_.\r\n\r\n@yarikoptic I'd agree with the gut feeling, but I wonder why all these other daemons don't just create their own directories? The only thing I can think of is daemons which are executed with as non-root user and therefore need the init scripts to create directories for them (which isn't applicable with fail2ban currently).", issueCommentId = 16159423}
