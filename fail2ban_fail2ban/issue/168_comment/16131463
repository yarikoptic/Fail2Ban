The openSuse _fail2ban_ package maintainer needs to include a tmpfiles.d[1] file for fail2ban. Please see #142 for the current discussion on fail2ban standard issue systemd config files (and a tmpfiles.d config file you can use :smile:)\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/tmpfiles.d.html", issueCommentId = 16131463}
