OpenSuse 12.2 does not have a full integration of systemd, whereas 12.3 has (according to the release notes http://en.opensuse.org/Features#systemd), but the differences for regular daemon services seem tiny. The package I installed was not furnished with a service file, so I made my own, but I am quite new to systemd (thank you for the reference).\r\n\r\n@yarikoptic I side with you about the role of exception. I did not thought about starting script as a non root user.\r\n\r\nAbout the fact the system should create socket directory rather than the client, I was wondering what if the user change the default socket directory or ask for another one in command line start? The system will not be aware of this, will it?", issueCommentId = 16148281}
