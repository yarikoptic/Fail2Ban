This avoids a BAN-UNBAN-BAN-UNBAN cycles if the bantime is shorter than the \"attack time\".\r\n\r\nSecondly, as I defined a (custom) filter to read the iptables-logging in the kernel logs, and the DShield service supports this native iptables-format, I use the 'matches' to report to DShield.", issueState = "open", issueId = 3481777, issueComments = 3, issueMilestone = Nothing}
