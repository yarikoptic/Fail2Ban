Your nagios script looks much more thorough than the one we have in place.  If only it was in Python, we could even make it avoid scraping of the fail2ban-client's output and make it an integral part of the Fail2Ban...\r\n\r\nMeanwhile -- I would be glad to add \"check_fail2ban_activity\" (mention explicit lack of the .pl suffix -- not needed with shebang and in general not advised -- users do not care about implementation language, and eventually it might become just a pure Python script ;) ) within current master and probably document that it is destined to replace current check_fail2ban .   Just send a PR. \r\n\r\nOr would you prefer some other course of action?", issueCommentId = 15457734}
