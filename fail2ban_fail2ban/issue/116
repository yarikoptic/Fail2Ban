In jail.conf backend=auto meant gamin was being used as python-inotify was not installed.\r\n\r\nI updated to fail2ban v0.8.8 from the EPEL repository. Installation of python-inotify occurred as a dependency at the same time. Fail2ban stopped banning after the first log rotation occurred.\r\n\r\nFor the moment I have put  \r\n```\r\n[DEFAULT] \r\nbackend=gamin\r\n```\r\n\r\ninto the jail.local and it works again.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nChris", issueState = "open", issueId = 10828218, issueComments = 1, issueMilestone = Nothing}
