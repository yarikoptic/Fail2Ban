I am a bit against this approach solely because of the need to duplicate majority of the action lines, while changing only iptables -> iptables6.  Also some actions might be agnostic to the IP family, i.e. have the same command for both, it would be really silly to duplicate those especially\r\n3. but the rest of the code (without family-tag matching) is useful in general since we discussed (or I blurbed) about necessity to specify \"supported\" address families (so some action files could be ignored entirely if address family is not matching), and possibly just make ```<ipfamily>``` tag exposed to be passed to the underlying tool", issueCommentId = 11291846}
