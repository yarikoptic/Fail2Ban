ATM, in case of command line arguments having no ipv4 or v6, it would run both commands. although it is unlikely to occur that anyone running that old iptables since ip6tables has been present for ages, it might cause a problem with some other firewalls, and cause unneeded commands execution on boxes of those who do not even have ipv6 setup...  But I guess we could leave it for someone to complaint/fix, meanwhile removing this misleading configuration statement and providing documentation in common.conf on how to disable ipv6 commands by replacing them with /bin/true ;)   sounds reasonable?\r\n", issueCommentId = 10248302}
