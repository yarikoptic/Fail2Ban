All implementation, documentation and test cases done excluding one known problem in the IPv6banprefix (banning more than a single IPv6 address is almost mandatory as attackers are likely assigned provided /64 IPv6 blocks).\r\n\r\nOn the status of the action scripts:\r\n* complain - no change required\r\n* mynetwatchman - have emailed them to ask about support \r\n* dshield - SANs people say IPv6 is in the works\r\n* route - have mechanism as per the pull request\r\n* dummy - no change required\r\n* ipfilter.conf - needs change. Seeking clarification from BSD people.\r\n* ipfw.conf - change required - need to clarify with BSD people or setup VM  - freebsd ports has own version - http://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/py-fail2ban/files/patch-bsd-ipfw.conf?view=markup have emailed maintainer asking if its ok to merge\r\n* iptables-* - easy change\r\n* iptables-ipset-proto4 / iptables-ipset-proto6 - easy change\r\n* iptables-xt_recent-echo - seems not to support CIDR in banning\r\n* mail*/ sendmail* - Have made small change to list CIDR of banned IP rather than just IP\r\n* shorewall.conf - change to shorewall6 as command.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of ipfw, ipfilter, dshield and mynetwatchman all other action configs have IP support and configs to support them are here: https://github.com/grooverdan/fail2ban/tree/ipv6/config/action.d", issueCommentId = 15089167}
