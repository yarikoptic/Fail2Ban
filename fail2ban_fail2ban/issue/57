But any one of the enabled jail with same filter will block the IP address. And other jails are not working properly.\n\nWhile verifying the status of each jails, any one of the jail have \"Currently failed\" and \"Total failed\" list and all other jails status having zero in \"Currently failed\" and \"Total failed\" list. \n\nMy jail.conf configuration are as follows,\n\n[ssh-iptables]\n\nenabled  = true\nfilter   = sshd\naction   = iptables[name=SSH, port=ssh, protocol=tcp]\n           sendmail-whois[name=SSH, dest=root, sender=fail2ban@localhost]\nlogpath  = /var/log/secure\nbantime  = 600\nfindtime  = 300\nmaxretry = 3\n\n[ssh-frequent]\n\nenabled  = true\nfilter   = sshd\naction   = iptables-allports[name=SSH-FREQUENT, protocol=all]\n           sendmail-whois[name=SSH-FREQUENT, dest=root, sender=fail2ban@localhost]\nlogpath  = /var/log/secure\nbantime  = 86400\nfindtime  = 604800\nmaxretry = 20\n\nIs this above jail configuration have any problem?. If yes, please suggest configuration to block the IP with different bantime and findtime for same filter and jail.\n\nMy Fail2ban version: Fail2Ban v0.8.6\nMy Python version: Python 2.6.8\n\nRegards,\nVella", issueState = "open", issueId = 5002129, issueComments = 4, issueMilestone = Just (Milestone {milestoneCreator = GithubUser {githubOwnerAvatarUrl = "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6a424256589825f609fd3477144355a0?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png", githubOwnerLogin = "yarikoptic", githubOwnerUrl = "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", githubOwnerId = 39889, githubOwnerGravatarId = "6a424256589825f609fd3477144355a0"}, milestoneDueOn = Just (GithubDate {fromGithubDate = 2012-11-11 08:00:00 UTC}), milestoneOpenIssues = 2, milestoneNumber = 3, milestoneClosedIssues = 5, milestoneDescription = "Fresh bugfix + enhancements", milestoneTitle = "0.8.8", milestoneUrl = "https://api.github.com/repos/fail2ban/fail2ban/milestones/3", milestoneCreatedAt = GithubDate {fromGithubDate = 2012-11-08 21:25:43 UTC}, milestoneState = "open"})}
