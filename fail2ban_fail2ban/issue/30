That is an expensive operation if log files are not rotated frequently.  Ideally upon restart f2b should look only in the tail of the file as far back in time as as 'bantime'. \r\n\r\nProbably it is ok to just read them in the reversed order.\r\n\r\nThe easiest and least inefficient implementation could use 'reversed()' while reading whole file into RAM, thus might be prohibitively inefficient.
