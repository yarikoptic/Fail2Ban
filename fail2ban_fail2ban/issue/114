And vice versa, removing the file disables the jail.  If I can accomplish this it opens up the possibility of having packages for activating jails, which would be the end goal I am looking to achieve.\r\n\r\nAn example would be vsftpd-iptables disabled in jail.conf:\r\n\r\n[vsftpd-iptables]\r\nenabled  = false\r\n......\r\n\r\nHowever in jail.d we have a vsftpd-iptables.conf that would override the default with the following:\r\n\r\n[vsftpd-iptables]\r\nenabled  = true\r\n......\r\n\r\nThis would work well with a package that drops a file in jails.d and when restarted f2b activates the jail and all the directives in the new file are used.  \r\n\r\nIs this even possible or has someone accomplished something along these lines?", issueState = "open", issueId = 10425511, issueComments = 10, issueMilestone = Nothing}
