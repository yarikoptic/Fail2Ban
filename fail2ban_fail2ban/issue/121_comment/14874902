Especially where it potentially includes failure cases. The exact meaning of X.d isn't intuitive and I wouldn't merge without documentation.\r\n\r\nI dislike the paradigm of do some file access tests and then read it. Do the read, catch an exception, and then diagnose for a friendly error message. It limits race conditions and excessive syscalls which while not significant in this case, sets a bad precedent for coding.", issueCommentId = 14874902}
