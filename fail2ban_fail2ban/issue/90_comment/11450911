But I grabbed some more\ninfo for you.\n\nIt shouldn't matter what Debian does. I'm running python >= 2.3 (2.5.2)\nand I installed the latest available pyinotify (0.8.9). The Chinese are\nconstantly trying to hack into our mail server to send their spam. They\nhave had some success due to weak passwords on our end. So I don't want\nto leave this layer of protection off for very long making testing\ndifficult and as I said I don't really have the time to setup a test\nserver and simulate failures.\n\nAttached is \"fail2ban.log\" which is a log with debugging info.\n\"tests.log\" is the output from fail2ban-testcases. Strange that it has\nseveral failures in polling, when that seems to work.\n\nTHX - Jon", issueCommentId = 11450911}
