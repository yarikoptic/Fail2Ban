I guess there should be performance advantage, but how much? \r\n\r\nwhy bother to introduce ipsets' managed bantime (in proto6) since actiounban is defined anyways (might lead to spurious errors while running unban if ban already timedout, isn't it?)?\r\n\r\nwould it work for both ipv4 and ipv6 without any changes?\r\n\r\ncould you provide exemplar jail definitions (probably for sshd filter)?", issueCommentId = 11245846}
