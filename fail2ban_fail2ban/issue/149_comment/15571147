And since this is not the first patch of this kind I'm try to push, I know that some people don't share my views on this. That's good, it forces me to have the best explanation I could give ;)\r\n\r\nI totally agree on the fact that it adds some code, so it can introduces some issues I didn't notice. That's why I kind of stole the idea from gunicorn, because it's a really mature project (so is fail2ban by the way).\r\n\r\nThis pull request is not about CPU performance in the regular meaning. It must be seen as an energy saver patch, and this is exactly the point I know some people don't care about :) However, fail2ban  has 1 wakeup/second for each jail. It means that if you have 20 jails, your CPU will just wakeup 20 times per second for nothing. With this patch, you can add as many jail as you want, and if there is no activity in the watched log, your CPU will be fully available for the other task (given you're not using file polling).\r\n\r\nCurrently, my personal home server, which currently runs 2 DNS server, a web server, 3 python WSGI, a rail application, postgresql, postfix, dovecot and dspam, php-fpm, a xmpp server and 8 other small services is only woken up 12 to 20 times per second when idling. I have 4 jails, so an addition of 4 wakeups would result in a 20% increase for just doing nothing. I know the actual figures are not really impressive, but I think that the fact this patch make fail2ban a little bit more scalable is a good thing.\r\n\r\nAnd anyway, fail2ban is kind of a watchdog, it should be as low profile as possible.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you're noticing some issue, I'm here to fix this. I just want fail2ban to be better for everyone, not just for me.", issueCommentId = 15571147}
