It needs the files from the abs fail2ban. I hacked this PKGBUILD together. I suggest you try using iptables rules instead of ufw. I installed pyjournalctl using pip2 (python2-pip) for my test. Ufw prevented all new ssh connections but it did add the deny rule. I tried your ufw commands and I couldn't get \"insert 1\" to work. I've never used ufw and perhaps it shows :). I can't reach the AUR from my computer atm to compare our PKGBUILDs.", issueCommentId = 12720760}
