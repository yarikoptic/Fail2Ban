I wanted to standardise the naming of `journal` (some places was it was `journald`).\r\nI also changed the naming of the backend to `pyjournalctl` as this aligns with naming for other backends, being based on the python module being used. This also would allow other journal based backends, utilising `JournalFilter` from `server.filter`, to be added in future.\r\nOne issues is that _fail2ban-regex_ journal option is currently reliant of `pyjournalctl`, as python doesn't have a standard interface like it does with files :)\r\n\r\nI think this is pretty much ready. It'd be nice to get more people testing it, as @bluephoenix47 and @pedrosland have had mixed success.\r\n@yarikoptic Did you have chance to try testing on Fedora (FYI watch out for _selinux_ ;) )? Are there any more changes you think are required?", issueCommentId = 13036504}
