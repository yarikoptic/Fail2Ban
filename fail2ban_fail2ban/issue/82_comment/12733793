Not sure if issues with tests failing are related to #103.\r\n\r\nOn Fedora I did have issues with jail reader trying to add the default log paths to the journal filter. I think this didn't trip on Arch Linux as the default log path `/var/log/messages` doesn't exist.  Commit 230007c has resolved this. This may be the issue you were having @bluephoenix47?", issueCommentId = 12733793}
