The tests work by actually sending message to the journal, so they require the systemd python module for this. It should be include with systemd install, or an additional package from your distro's repository (e.g. in Fedora the package is called [systemd-python](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/systemd-python/overview)).\r\n\r\nI also found issues with blocking C calls, so I've updated `pyjournalctl` to release the python GIL. I recommend updating to `pyjournalctl 0.5.0` before running tests, as it will likely cause issues without. (Available on [github](https://github.com/kwirk/pyjournalctl) or [pypi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyjournalctl))\r\n\r\nThanks again for any testing :)", issueCommentId = 12468575}
