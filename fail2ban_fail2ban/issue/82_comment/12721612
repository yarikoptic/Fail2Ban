Even with iptables I\r\ncannot get this to work with journald. The fail2ban jails never trigger,\r\nso it doesn't matter what action they're supposed to take.\r\n\r\nOur PKGBUILDs differ in very minimal ways; I also based mine off the ABS\r\nfail2ban and use the ABS fail2ban files. I, however, use @kwirk's AUR\r\npackage as a dependency instead of installing it via python2-pip. \r\n\r\nOn Fri, Jan 25, 2013 at 01:04:05PM -0800, pedrosland wrote:\r\n> @bluephoenix47 I created this PKGBUILD http://sprunge.us/IWhE. It needs the files from the abs fail2ban. I hacked this PKGBUILD together. I suggest you try using iptables rules instead of ufw. I installed pyjournalctl using pip2 (python2-pip) for my test. Ufw prevented all new ssh connections but it did add the deny rule. I tried your ufw commands and I couldn't get \"insert 1\" to work. I've never used ufw and perhaps it shows :). I can't reach the AUR from my computer atm to compare our PKGBUILDs.\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/pull/82#issuecomment-12720760", issueCommentId = 12721612}
