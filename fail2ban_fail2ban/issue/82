I've added code to allow fail2ban to read from journald and also allow to set match filters as per journalctl. As far as I can tell, all/most the regex filters still work.\r\n\r\nIt required use of a python interface to journald, which I couldn't find anywhere, so I've knocked one up myself. It's python c-api wrap around the systemd journal C API, sd-journal. Code for this is on my github https://github.com/kwirk/pyjournalctl\r\n\r\nInitial testing shows all working okay, but if anyone else could do some testing, that would be great.\r\n\r\nAny feedback appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n", issueState = "open", issueId = 7920213, issueComments = 60, issueMilestone = Just (Milestone {milestoneCreator = GithubUser {githubOwnerAvatarUrl = "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6a424256589825f609fd3477144355a0?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png", githubOwnerLogin = "yarikoptic", githubOwnerUrl = "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", githubOwnerId = 39889, githubOwnerGravatarId = "6a424256589825f609fd3477144355a0"}, milestoneDueOn = Nothing, milestoneOpenIssues = 4, milestoneNumber = 2, milestoneClosedIssues = 6, milestoneDescription = "New feature release", milestoneTitle = "0.9.0", milestoneUrl = "https://api.github.com/repos/fail2ban/fail2ban/milestones/2", milestoneCreatedAt = GithubDate {fromGithubDate = 2012-05-21 13:19:52 UTC}, milestoneState = "open"})}
