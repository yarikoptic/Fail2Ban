Reading http://people.gnome.org/~veillard/gamin/config.html I tried changing from kernel/notify to poll backend and all the tests now passing.\r\n\r\nCreate file ~/.gaminrc with the following contents:\r\n\r\n    poll /tmp/*\r\n\r\n\r\nLooks like the issue is with Gamin not picking up the changes with kernel/notify setting. I also tried changing the test to write files on local disk (added `dir=\".\"` to `mkstemp`), thinking it could be to do with tmpfs file system, but I had the same problems. (FYI you need to kill the gamin server between testing as it may not have timed out `pkill gam_server`)\r\n\r\nNot sure if this helps:\r\nGamin version _0.1.10_\r\nLinux kernel version _3.6.11_\r\n\r\nIt seems that gamin's functionality is equivalent to _polling_ and _pyinotify_ backends anywho, depending on configuration, so I suppose its sort of redundent...?", issueCommentId = 12860378}
