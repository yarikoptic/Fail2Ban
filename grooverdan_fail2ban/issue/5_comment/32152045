Contributions of a useful substance are always be made use of regardless of form.\r\n\r\nIts probably not possible to include more than one change using the web interface of github alone. Use https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo to create a fork. Use git checkout -b new_feature to create a branch. Commit changes to that branch. Push the branch back (git push origin new_feature), and then go to github on your page to create a pull request.\r\n\r\nAlso take a fork of the main https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban repository rather than mine. It will get stuff in easier.\r\n\r\nYour requests are now here: https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/pull/584"
