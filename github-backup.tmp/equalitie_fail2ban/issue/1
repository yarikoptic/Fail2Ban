                  "The problem with new filter is that Fail2ban does not make different filter based on different type of regex/model etc (although can make different type of filter based on polling mechanism).\r\n\r\nSo when we call addModel or addRegex the filter is already instantiated. These alls happens in server/jail.py\r\n\r\nSo solution:\r\n\r\n1. Easy: Don't distinguish between regex filters and model filters, later on filter decides if it has model or Regex.\r\n\r\n2. Medium (and dirty): each Jail has two filters and use based on if addModel or addRegex is called.\r\n\r\n3. Hard: Have  two different class, postpone instantiation till you see which one \r\n\r\nNumber 2 is dirty and against Fail2ban prinicipal of one filter per jail.\r\n\r\nOf course 1 has the benefit of being easy. Number 3 has the benifit of adhering both to object oriented principals.\r\nHowever, in addition to be easy the first model has the benefit of that a filter can do either regex or Model.\r\n\r\nThat's said, I'm going to adapt (change to; I was doing 3 till now) strategy 1, unless I face a serieus obstecle or opposition\r\n"
